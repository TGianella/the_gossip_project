# The Gossip Project

Clone the repo, `bundle install`, run the server, and get going : it's a fully functionning (modest) social network where users can do all kind of things:
- Sign up, sign in, sign out, recover their password (thanks to Devise)
- post gossips
- comment (and comment comments !)
- like all kind of stuff (posts, comments, users).

All the front-end is done in Bootstrap.
